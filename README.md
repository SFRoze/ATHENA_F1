## 🎮 Usage Examples

### Real-Time Race Strategy
```python
from src.algorithms.monte_carlo_strategy import WorldClassMonteCarloStrategy
from src.data.models import RaceState, DriverState

# Initialize ATHENA F1
athena = WorldClassMonteCarloStrategy()

# Analyze current race situation
strategies = await athena.simulate_strategy_outcomes(
    race_state, driver_state, strategy_options
)

# Get top recommendation
best_strategy = athena.rank_strategies_advanced(strategies)[0]
print(f"Recommended: {best_strategy.strategy_type} on lap {best_strategy.execute_on_lap}")
```
