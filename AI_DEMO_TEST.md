- Pit Stop: 0.23
- SC Wait: 0.61
```

**⚖️ AI Decision Fusion:**
```
Weighted Analysis:
Monte Carlo (40%): Safety Car Wait (0.82)
Neural Network (60%): Stay Out (0.67)
Combined Score: Stay Out (0.73)

CONFIDENCE CALIBRATION: 91%
(Adjusted from base 73% using historical accuracy)
```

### 🎯 **FINAL AI DECISION:**
**STRATEGY:** Extend stint by 8 laps, then pit for Hard tires
**REASONING:** "Track position crucial at Monaco, tire degradation manageable for 8 more laps, fresh Hard tires will provide strong final stint pace"
**SUCCESS PROBABILITY:** 91%

## 🥈 **DRIVER: Lewis Hamilton (P2)**

### Input Parameters:
```
Position: P2
Tire: Medium, 25 laps, 65% degradation (CRITICAL)
Gaps: -8.3s to P1, +12.1s to P3
Fuel: 62kg remaining
Driver Skills: [Racecraft: 97%, Tire Mgmt: 98%, Wet: 99%]
```

### AI Processing:

**🔧 Advanced Tire Analysis:**
```
Degradation Model: Linear (Medium compound)
Current grip: 0.73 (down from 0.92 peak)
Remaining life: 8 laps maximum
Performance drop: 2.1% per additional lap
Monaco tire stress: 0.4 (LOW - street circuit)
```

**🎲 Monte Carlo Analysis:**
```
Undercut Verstappen (Soft tires):
- Simulated 10,000 scenarios
- Success rate: 68%
- Average final position: 1.3
- Time gain potential: +4.2s
- Risk assessment: Medium-High

Conservative Pit (Medium tires):
- Success rate: 89%
- Final position: 2.1
- Safe strategy with track position hold
```

**🧠 Neural Pattern Recognition:**
```
Historical Hamilton Data:
- Undercut success rate: 73%
- Monaco-specific adjustment: -15% (difficult overtaking)
- Gap feasibility: 82% (8.3s within range)
- Tire advantage calculation: +3.1s per lap

Final Neural Output:
- Undercut: 0.81 ⭐ AGGRESSIVE
- Conservative: 0.71
- Extend: 0.22 (too risky)
```

**🎯 Multi-Objective Optimization:**
```
Position Gain Weight (40%): Undercut scores 0.85
Championship Points (25%): Undercut scores 0.78
Risk-Adjusted Return (15%): Conservative scores 0.91
Consistency (10%): Conservative scores 0.89
Strategic Value (10%): Undercut scores 0.92

FINAL WEIGHTED SCORE: Undercut (0.83)
```

### 🏁 **FINAL AI DECISION:**
**STRATEGY:** Undercut attack on Lap 35 with Soft tires
**REASONING:** "Gap within undercut window, Hamilton's elite tire management and historical undercut success support aggressive move. Tire degradation critical - must act now"
**SUCCESS PROBABILITY:** 81% (Neural) × 68% (Monte Carlo) = **74% Weighted**

## 🥉 **DRIVER: Charles Leclerc (P8)**

### Input Parameters:
```
Position: P8 (Recovery drive scenario)
Tire: Medium, 5 laps, 10% degradation (FRESH)
Gaps: -15.2s to P7, -23.8s to P6
Fuel: 71kg (heavy load)
Driver Skills: [Racecraft: 94%, Tire Mgmt: 88%, Wet: 92%]
```

### AI Recovery Analysis:

**🎲 Monte Carlo Recovery Scenarios:**
```
Long Stint Strategy:
- Extend 15+ laps beyond optimal
- Success: 67%, Target: P5
- High risk due to tire degradation

Two-Stop Aggressive:
- Lap 45: Medium → Soft
- Lap 58: Soft → Soft
- Success: 73%, Target: P6

Alternative Single-Stop:
- Lap 48: Medium → Hard
- Success: 84%, Target: P6 ⭐ SAFEST
```

**🧠 Neural Recovery Intelligence:**
```
Leclerc Profile Adjustments:
- Tire management: 0.88 (good, not elite)
- Monaco racecraft: 0.94 (excellent)
- Fresh tire advantage: +2.1s per lap initially

Pattern Recognition:
- Alternative strategy historical success: 78%
- Monaco Hard tire performance: Excellent
- Recovery drive probability: 69%
```

### 🎯 **FINAL AI DECISION:**
**STRATEGY:** Alternative single-stop (Medium → Hard on Lap 48)
**REASONING:** "Fresh tires provide significant pace advantage, Hard compound suits Monaco's low tire stress, alternative strategy offers highest success probability"
**SUCCESS PROBABILITY:** 84%
